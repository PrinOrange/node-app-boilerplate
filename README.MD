# Node.js with TypeScript Boilerplate

[中文](README-CN.MD)

Empty Nodejs with TypeScript template.

This is the boilerplate for nodejs with typescript, which is generated by Webpack.

You could write your code here with needed dependencies and configurations. 

## Usage

If you visit this project on github, you can use the template of this project directly. Click Use this template to create your project.

Or you can use this command in your directory:

```bash
git clone --depth 1 --branch main https://github.com/PrinOrange/node-app-boilerplate <your-project-name>
cd <your-project-name>
npm install
```

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start your project.

## Available Scripts

Start building.The `build` command creates outputs in both development and production modes. It will not automatically run after the `build` is complete.

```bash
npm run build
```

Start with development mode. Running the program in development mode enables `hot-restart`.

```bash
npm run dev
```

Start with production mode. But `hot-restart` is not enabled when running in production.

```bash
npm run start
```

To clean build outputs, you can use `clean` command. It will clear all build artifacts, including production mode and development mode.

```
npm run clean
```
